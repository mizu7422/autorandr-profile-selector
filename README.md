I might not finish this because it works, but if someone that also needs this for themselves here it is.

(now that I think about it, this is kinda useless)

## Usage

```bash
cargo build --release
```

then add a keybind in you config to execute /path-to-project/target/release/autorand-profile-selector with floating option(preference I guess)

Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch profile

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to switch profile and quit

Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to quit without switching
